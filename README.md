TH-MtG
======

TH-MtG is short for "Touhou - Magic: The Gathering,"
an amateur project where the design and development
methods used to create Magic cards are utilized to
create a fully-workable, standalone Magic block
based off of the Touhou Project.

The original project is started by EverFrozenMore 
(that's me! haha); however, since I don't have 
access to a lot of resources, anyone is welcome 
to provide input or even help out with the 
project.  That can include the card design, 
development, or even card art.  Even something 
as seemingly innocent as a comment will be
very much appreciated! ^-^
